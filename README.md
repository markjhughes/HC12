Example01 is a simple proof-of-concept sketch that allows a user to determine if everything is wired correctly and working.
Example02 is a versatile sketch that handles local and remote control of HC12 transmitters using AT commands.
Example03 integrates a GPS receiver into the mix
Example04 provides NMEA sentence decoding and transmission.
